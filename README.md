* provide their availability for scheduling purposes.
2. Allow permanent staff to:
* view a list of people interested in their unit, including their details (contact
details, qualifications etc.), and availability.
3. **Login and Registration Page** – This is the main page that applicants and employers see upon entering the app. This is the priority of the application.
4. **Resume submitting and checking** – This feature is a top priority for applicants, as they need to upload their resumes to apply for a job.
5. **Save/Bookmark Interested Roles** – This feature is also a priority as it allows applicants to receive updates on their bookmarked roles via email.
6. **Search Bar** – This is the second priority of the project as it allows users to search for their preferred fields of work and information about companies and staff.
7. **Support** – This feature serves as a quick/emergency contact option for users who encounter issues.
